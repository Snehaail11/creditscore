# Credit Score Prediction

This project predicts an individual's credit score based on their financial behavior and personal data. It simulates a real-world use case where users can input their information and receive a predicted credit score, along with suggestions for improvement.

## What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed raw financial data, handling missing values and outliers.
- Performed feature selection to identify key indicators of creditworthiness.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
- Finalized Random Forest after comparing model performance and interpretability.
- Built a simulation to show how changes in certain inputs could improve credit scores.

## Why This Project Matters

Credit scoring is a key part of financial decision-making. This project shows how I can take messy data, turn it into something usable, and build a solution that helps users understand and improve their standing.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Feature importance and model explainability tools
- Flask for frontend (if included)
- HTML,CSS,JS for interface styling
